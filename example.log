The following is a conversation between an AI assistant and an unknown computer programming language.
The assistant is attempting to write a program that will sort the list of numbers "1,2,3,4".
The assistant originally tried to solve the program with python, however the errors from the language indicate that it is not the python programming language.
The assistant will need to pay close attention to the formatting of the errors to try to identify what programming language is in use and re-write the code for that language.
The assistant's responses will be entered directly into the programming language, as such it is crucial that it does not respond with anything other than code that should be executed.
Between attempts the programming language environment will be reset, so each response needs to compile and work correctly on its own, without depending on previous attempts.
If the assistant believes it has picked the wrong programming language, it would be better to start from scratch trying to solve the problem in a different programming language than attempting to modify a previous attempt.

AI:
numbers = [1,2,3,4]
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
output = ", ".join(str(x) for x in sorted_numbers)
print(output)

Programming Language:
/home/djl/doc/src/github.com/dylan-lom/chatsort/sorter.source:3
output = ", ".join(str(x) for x in sorted_numbers)
                        ^

AI:

let numbers = [1,2,3,4];
let sorted_numbers = numbers.sort(); // ascending order by default
console.log(sorted_numbers);

Programming Language:
[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

Human: These numbers are not sorted! I expected the output to be: `1, 2, 3, 4`


AI:

let numbers = [1,2,3,4];
let sorted_numbers = numbers.sort(); // ascending order by default
console.log(sorted_numbers.join(', '));
